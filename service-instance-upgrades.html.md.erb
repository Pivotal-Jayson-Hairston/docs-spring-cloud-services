## <a id="service-instance-upgrade-steps"></a>Service Instance Upgrade Steps

After an upgrade of the Spring Cloud Services product, follow the below steps to upgrade an individual service instance.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: If you have client applications which work with Spring Cloud Services 1.0.x service instances and are upgrading these service instances to 1.2.x, you must update your client applications to use the current version of the Spring Cloud Services client dependencies. See <a href="#client-application-changes-in-1-0-0">Client Application Changes in 1.1.0</a> below.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: After upgrading a Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance from 1.0.x to 1.2.x, you must unbind, rebind, and restart any client applications which were bound to the instance. This is due to a change in how service instance credentials are managed.</p>

Run `cf update-service -c '{"upgrade":true}' SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of a service instance:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-service -c '{"upgrade": true}' config-server
Updating service instance config-server as admin...
OK

Update in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service config-server' to check operation status.
</pre>

As the output from the command suggests, you can use the `cf services` or `cf service` commands to check the status of the upgrade.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service config-server

Service instance: config-server
Service: p-config-server

When the upgrade is complete, `cf service SERVICE_NAME` will report a `Status` of `update succeeded`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service config-server

Service: p-config-server

## <a id="client-application-changes-in-1-0-0"></a>Client Application Changes in 1.1.0

The client dependencies for Spring Cloud Services were restructured in Spring Cloud Services version 1.1.0. In particular, the `spring-cloud-services-starter-parent` has been replaced with a `spring-cloud-services-dependencies` Maven BOM (<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies">Bill of Materials</a>), which does not include the Spring Cloud or Spring Boot dependency BOMs.

If your client applications are using dependencies corresponding to a 1.0.x version of Spring Cloud Services, you must update them to use the 1.2.x BOM and include the other requisite dependencies. See the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a> topic for details on the current client dependencies.
