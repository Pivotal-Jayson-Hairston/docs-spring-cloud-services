Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

## <a id="1-3"></a>1.3

### <a id="1-3-0-migrating-from-1-2-x"></a>Migrating from 1.2.x

If you are upgrading from a 1.2.x release of Spring Cloud Services, no changes are required for client applications or Spring Cloud Services service instances.

### <a id="1-3-0-migrating-from-1-1-x"></a>Migrating from 1.1.x

If you are upgrading from a 1.1.x release of Spring Cloud Services, no changes are required for client applications or Spring Cloud Services service instances.

### <a id="1-3-0-migrating-from-1-0-x"></a>Migrating from 1.0.x

The Spring Cloud Services client dependencies were restructured in 1.1.0. In 1.3.x, they are based on Spring Cloud Camden. To ensure compatibility of your client applications with Spring Cloud Services 1.3.x service instances, you must update your client applications to include the current dependencies and the Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Maven BOM dependencies. For information about upgrading Spring Cloud Services service instances after upgrading the Spring Cloud Services product, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/service-instance-upgrades.html">Service Instance Upgrades</a> topic. For complete information about the current Spring Cloud Services client dependencies, see <a href="/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a>.

After upgrading a 1.0.x Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance to a 1.3.x version, you must unbind, rebind, and restart any client applications which were bound to the instance. This is due to a change in how service instance credentials are managed.

### <a id="1-3-0"></a>1.3.0

**Release Date: 10th November 2016**

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: Spring Cloud Services 1.3.0 requires version 3.8 or later of the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack. If your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment is using an older version of the Java buildpack, upgrade it before installing this release.</p>

Enhancements included in this release:

* Spring Cloud Services now supports Pivotal Cloud Foundry versions 1.7 and later.
* Spring Cloud Services now uses a floating stemcell for enhanced security. For more information, see the [Understanding Floating Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html) topic in the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/).
* The validation normally performed by Spring Cloud Services for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Elastic Runtime SSL certificate can now be disabled by operators in the tile's settings. See step 5 of the Installation Steps in the [Installation](/spring-cloud-services/installation.html) topic for more information.
* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 1.4.1 and Spring Cloud Camden.SR2.
* Service instances are now based on Spring Cloud Camden.SR2, and client applications can use Spring Boot 1.3.x--1.4.1 and Spring Cloud Brixton.x--Camden.SR2. For more information about client application dependencies, see <a href="/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html">Client Dependencies</a>.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Spring Cloud Services 1.3.0 is compatible with Spring Boot versions 1.3.x--1.4.x, but is based on Spring Cloud Camden, which builds on Spring Boot 1.4. In client applications, Spring Boot 1.4.x is recommended for optimum experience with this release.</p>

## <a id="1-2"></a>1.2

### <a id="1-2-3"></a>1.2.3

**Release Date: 10th November 2016**

Enhancements included in this release:

* For increased security, the Service Registry now requires that a client application's `eureka.instance.secureVirtualHostname` and `eureka.instance.virtualHostname` properties, if set, match the client application's `eureka.instance.appname` property.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that client applications do not set either of the <code>eureka.instance.secureVirtualHostname</code> or <code>eureka.instance.virtualHostname</code> properties.</p>

### <a id="1-2-2"></a>1.2.2

**Release Date: 21st October 2016**

Enhancements included in this release:

* The stemcell has been updated to 3263.8. This resolves the following issues:
  * [[USN-3106-2]](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3106-2/): Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerability

### <a id="1-2-1"></a>1.2.1

**Release Date: 13th October 2016**

Enhancements included in this release:

* The stemcell has been updated to 3263.7 for stability and bug fixes.

### <a id="1-2-0"></a>1.2.0

**Release Date: 7th October 2016**

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Spring Cloud Services 1.2.0 is compatible with <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf">Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> (PCF) versions 1.6.x, 1.7.x, and 1.8.x. PCF 1.8 is recommended for optimum experience with this release.</p>

Enhancements included in this release:

* Service Registry service instances can now be configured to replicate service registrations across multiple PCF installations and availability zones.
* Service Registry service instances can now be configured to replicate service registrations across PCF organization and space boundaries.
* Service Registry service instances now allow multiple applications within a space to register with the same application name, so that registered applications can use a blue / green deployment strategy.
* Service Registry service instance dashboards now display the URI and, if a service instance is operating in high-availability (HA) mode, the local node count of the service instance.
* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 1.3.7 and Spring Cloud Brixton.SR5.
* The RabbitMQ Java client used by the Spring Cloud Services service broker has been upgraded to version 3.6.5. This resolves an issue where the Spring Cloud Services service broker could not provision service instances when the RabbitMQ for PCF product was using TLS and had its TLS 1.0 support disabled.

* The tile install and uninstall processes are now more resilient to errors encountered during the relevant errands.

Fixes included in this release:

* If the service broker worker fails to update a service instance when the service broker receives a provision or update request, the request to the service broker will now time out and the service instance status will be changed from PENDING to FAILED.
* Applications unbound from a Service Registry service instance will no longer remain in the service instance's registry and will be removed from that registry shortly after being unbound from the service instance.
* Fixed a problem where the service broker's authentication to the Cloud Controller would expire if the broker remained inactive for a long period of time.

For more information, see <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/creating-an-instance.html">Creating an Instance</a>, <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/updating-an-instance.html">Updating an Instance</a>, and <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/using-the-dashboard.html">Using the Dashboard</a> in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/">Config Server documentation</a>.
* When creating a Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance, the service broker now performs tasks in parallel for faster provisioning.

Known issues:

* Config Server currently does not support use of a private Git repository accessed via an authenticated proxy server as a configuration source. For more information, see <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/creating-an-instance.html">Creating an Instance</a> or <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/updating-an-instance.html">Updating an Instance</a> in the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/config-server/">Config Server documentation</a>.
* When upgrading a Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance from 1.0.x to 1.1.0, running applications must be unbound, rebound, and restarted, due to a change in how credentials are managed.

**Release Date: 26th October 2015**

Features included in this release:

* General Availability release

Known issues:

* [Feign](https://github.com/Netflix/feign) clients require [Spring Cloud Netflix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/) version 1.0.4. This release of Spring Cloud Services depends on Spring Cloud Netflix version 1.0.3. If you wish to use a Feign client with a Spring Cloud Services service instance, you must manually override the version of Spring Cloud Netflix used by your application.
<br/> <br/>
    Using Gradle:

    ```groovy
    ext["spring-cloud-netflix.version"] = "1.0.4.RELEASE"
    ```

    Using Maven:

    ```xml
    <properties>
        <!-- override the managed versions of Spring Cloud Netflix dependencies -->
        <spring-cloud-netflix.version>1.0.4.RELEASE</spring-cloud-netflix.version>
    </properties>
    ```
